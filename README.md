### Problem Statement:
Maternal and child health is a critical concern in many parts of
the world, including India. Despite significant progress in recent
years, there are still challenges related to maternal mortality,
infant mortality, and overall maternal and child well-being. Key
issues include inadequate access to quality healthcare,
nutrition, immunisation, and prenatal care, which can result in
adverse health outcomes for mothers and children.
Create a platform that addresses maternal and child health by
implementing comprehensive interventions and software
solutions to improve healthcare access, awareness, and
outcomes for mothers and children.

Key Features of our solution:
1. Provides prenatal care information, checklists, appointment
reminders, and educational resources about nutrition, hygiene,
and prenatal health to new parents and expecting parents.
2. Digital health record system for pregnant women
that tracks their health status, prenatal visits, and vital signs,
ensuring timely interventions and reducing maternal
complications.
3. Immunization tracking feature that reminds
parents about their child's vaccination schedule, provides
information on vaccine safety, and connects them to nearby
vaccination centers.
4. Nutrition and growth tracking feature that allows
parents to monitor the growth and nutritional status of infants
and young children, providing guidance on appropriate feeding
practices.
